# trade-py: Python trading SDK

## Goal

trade-py presents an uniform interface for getting market data and executing trades.
The goal is to abstract away the broker, so the same strategies developed during backtests can run live against various brokers without any code change.

# # Todo

- [ ] Define main interfaces
- [ ] Support backtest use case
